/*No need to have: OR REPLACE FUNCTION:
read here: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/plpgsql.html
"Another way to avoid this problem is to use CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION when updating the definition of my_function (when a function is "replaced",
its OID is not changed)."

-- abour RETURN QUERY and stuff (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/plpgsql-control-structures.html)
-- RETURN NEXT and RETURN QUERY do not actually return from the function â€” they simply append zero or more rows to the function's
-- result set. Execution then continues with the next statement in the PL/pgSQL function. As successive RETURN NEXT or RETURN QUERY
-- commands are executed, the result set is built up. A final RETURN, which should have no argument, causes control to exit the
-- function (or you can just let control reach the end of the function).

-- TODO /... should id's be positive??? I don't really see a reason on why
-- FIXME ... remove REPLACE FUNCTION from everywhere!
