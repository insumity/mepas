3) on the tests I had the problem with the expected exception message. I fixed
this by using "(?s) .." which transforms the regex in single line mode:
"(?s) for "single line mode" makes the dot match all characters, including line breaks. Not supported by Ruby or JavaScript. In Tcl, (?s) also makes the caret and dollar match at the start and end of the string only."
from http://www.regular-expressions.info/modifiers.html ... The problem was
that the exception message contained new lines

5) Arrays.asList(POSSIBLE_MESSAGE_LENGTHS) ... where array is of primitive type will return a list containing only
one element the array. REad more here (in the comments section): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1128723/in-java-how-can-i-test-if-an-array-contains-a-certain-value
yerguds: indeed, this does not work for primitives. In java primitive types can't be generic. asList is declared as <T> List<T> asList(T...). When you pass an int[] into it, the compiler infers T=int[] because it can't infer T=int, because primitives can't be generic.

6) found with end-to-end .. had createQueue instead of sayHello in sayHello request. Ok ... about deleting the client
when he says Goodbye I had this problem. When the client was about to be deleted there were perhaps stil lmessages from him
in the system ... and therefore we got a foreign key constraint violation. I could use CASCADE to delete the messages
but I didn't belive this is correct.
