While doing db integration testing

1) Inside an SQL function I had:
        RETURN QUERY SELECT id INTO received_message_id ...
 and although this was passing from PostgresSQL I received
 error message in Java when trying to execute the query. The
 error message was: 'PSQLException ERROR: cannot open SELECT query as cursor'

2) Another error I found was the following. In receive_message_from_sender
I had SELECT * FROM
     WHERE sender_id = p_sender_id AND receiver_id = p_requesting_user_id OR
           receiver_id IS NULL
Here I forgot to have the paranthesis so because of operator precendence
(http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.2/static/sql-precedence.html) it ended up
doing this instead:
(sender_id = p_sender_id AND receiver_id = p_requesting_user_id) OR
           receiver_id IS NULL

3) on the tests I had the problem with the expected exception message. I fixed
this by using "(?s) .." which transforms the regex in single line mode:
"(?s) for "single line mode" makes the dot match all characters, including line breaks. Not supported by Ruby or JavaScript. In Tcl, (?s) also makes the caret and dollar match at the start and end of the string only."
from http://www.regular-expressions.info/modifiers.html ... The problem was
that the exception message contained new lines

4) While testing I found a nullPointerexception bug in Message equals. I had this.receiverId.equals(other.receiverId)
and receiverId can be null

5) Arrays.asList(POSSIBLE_MESSAGE_LENGTHS) ... where array is of primitive type will return a list containing only
one element the array. REad more here (in the comments section): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1128723/in-java-how-can-i-test-if-an-array-contains-a-certain-value
yerguds: indeed, this does not work for primitives. In java primitive types can't be generic. asList is declared as <T> List<T> asList(T...). When you pass an int[] into it, the compiler infers T=int[] because it can't infer T=int, because primitives can't be generic.

6) found with end-to-end .. had createQueue instead of sayHello in sayHello request. Ok ... about deleting the client
when he says Goodbye I had this problem. When the client was about to be deleted there were perhaps stil lmessages from him
in the system ... and therefore we got a foreign key constraint violation. I could use CASCADE to delete the messages
but I didn't belive this is correct.

7) About making the users register by themselves .. I had quite some problems ... e.g when creating the clients
other clients could already start sending messages to their peers but they don't exist yet. So we get failed messages
although this should never happen, or at least if it never happened it would be easier to test an experiment was correct.
Also, if the clients create the queues by themselves it could be that other clients already start sending messages
to the queue. If many clients try to create a qeueu, with the current API we could end up with multiple queues.
For these reasons and for th ereason afforementioned in 6) I chose not to let the clients to regiester when the
get in the middleware.

8) While creating the code for the experimental setup, sinc eI'm neewbie to python I had
        thread = threading.Thread(target=self.__startThreadCode(), args=())
        instead
        of         thread = threading.Thread(target=self.__startThreadCode, args=())
check here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15946075/python-threading-blocks why this was wrong
